# California Housing Market
Exploring Machine Models through California Housing Data

I'm going to explore different models using the California Housing Data found on Kaggle. I'm starting will Cluster data to show how different the housing market realliy is in California, this can be helpful for those that are not familiar with California's diverse regions. 

In the data you'll see that I use 7 clusters to give the best representation overview of the different regions in California and the average prices.
